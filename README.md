# VIMFILES

This is my vim folder, I'm just learning to customize the editor, but if you like this you're free to fork it! 

# PLUGINS INSTALLED

* NerdTree: The best file browser for VIM I've tried.
* Zencoding: Fast HTML and CSS editing
* snipMate: Like Textmate's snippets in VIM, with a similar syntax.
* tComment: A plugin to comment lines and block of lines.
